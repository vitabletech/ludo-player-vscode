# 🎮 Game Controls Implementation

## ✅ **Current Features:**
The extension now includes proper game control mechanisms:

## 🎯 **Start/Stop Game Control:**

### **Welcome Screen (Default State)**
- The sidebar starts with a welcome screen instead of immediately loading the game
- Shows a "Start Game" button
- Displays memory optimization status
- No resources consumed until user clicks "Start Game"

### **Game Controls**
When the game is running, you have:
- **🔄 Refresh Button**: Reload the game if it gets stuck
- **⏹️ Stop Button**: Completely stops the game and returns to welcome screen
- **Header Info**: Shows game status and VS Code integration

## 🚀 **How to Control the Game:**

### **Method 1: In-Game Controls**
- Click the **🔄** button in the game header to refresh
- Click the **⏹️** button in the game header to stop the game

### **Method 2: Command Palette**
- `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Play Ludo" - Opens the sidebar and starts/focuses the game
- The existing command now intelligently handles starting and focusing

### **Method 3: Sidebar Management**
- **Collapse the sidebar**: Game continues running but uses minimal resources
- **Expand the sidebar**: Game resumes where you left off
- **Close the entire activity**: Game stops completely

## 💡 **Resource Management:**
- **Game Stopped**: Zero resource usage, shows welcome screen
- **Game Running**: Normal resource usage with the iframe
- **Sidebar Collapsed**: Minimal resource usage (game paused in background)

## 🎮 **Usage Recommendations:**
1. **Start playing**: Click the game icon in activity bar → Click "Start Game"
2. **Take a break**: Click the ⏹️ stop button to free resources
3. **Quick pause**: Just collapse the sidebar
4. **Resume playing**: Click "Start Game" again or use "Play Ludo" command

This approach gives you full control over when the game runs and when resources are freed up!
